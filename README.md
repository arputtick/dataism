Repository for School of Machines, Dataism course.

## Homework
**Week 1:**
* Use colab to open and work through Homework 1.ipynb
* Go to https://policescorecard.org/
   - Explore the front page to see how the project is presented
   - Read the "About the Data" section
   - Write down three questions you have about the project
   - If you're curious, check out the Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/campaignzero/ca-police-scorecard/
* Supplementary: Read Chapter 5 of 'Weapons of Math Destruction.'

**Week 2:**
* Watch some youtube videos on matrix multiplication if you're not familiar
* Work through Scores_Procentiles.ipynb
* Check out these videos : 
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufAlSgXIPB4 - TEDx from Adam Harvey
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch2ubo7fC84 - News Story, Dazzle Club, London
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufAlSgXIPB4 - Video About Clearview AI
   
**Week 3:**
* Work through Jupyter notebooks on Supervised Learning and the assignment on Linear Regression
* Explore the USC Center for AI for Society projects: https://cais.usc.edu/projects
   * In particular: Substance abuse/HIV prevention
   * There are videos giving a brief overview of each project

   * Google AutoML - Tools for automatically building image recognition and language models using user-inputed datasets. Requires no ML knowledge (besides understanding what supervised learning is)

NOTE: I'm not a fun of Andrew Ng's 'Machine Learning' course on Coursera. It's good for basic concepts, but there's not very much practical knowledge. It also doesn't use Python. His deep learning course is more useful.

**On self-teaching:**
If you really wanna get started on deep learning I'd recommend picking one practical course (like fast.ai/tensorflow in practice) and one theory course (like deeplearning.ai) and going back and forth depending on how you feel. Then if you want can move on to hardcore stuff like CS231 and the Deep Learning book by Goodfellow et. al.

The same goes for stats. For me it makes such a difference to stumble through projects and learn theory side by side. Otherwise I get either bored or stuck.

In my opinion, you need to know enough coding to understand if-statements and for-loops and a maybe a couple day primer (like the google one) on Python to get started.
