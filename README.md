# Homework
**Week 1:**
* Use colab to open and work through Homework 1.ipynb
* Go to https://policescorecard.org/
   - Explore the front page to see how the project is presented
   - Read the "About the Data" section
   - Write down three questions you have about the project
   - If you're curious, check out the Jupyter Notebook: https://github.com/campaignzero/ca-police-scorecard/
* Supplementary: Read Chapter 5 of 'Weapons of Math Destruction.'

**Week 2:**
* Watch some youtube videos on matrix multiplication if you're not familiar
* Work through Scores_Procentiles.ipynb
* Check out these videos : 
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufAlSgXIPB4 - TEDx from Adam Harvey
   * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch2ubo7fC84 - News Story, Dazzle Club, London

*Books*
* 'Weapons of Math Destruction,' Cathy O'Neil

*Online Courses*
* fast.ai online deep learning course (This is all about getting as fast as possible to the point where you can build a project and then filling in the theory afterward) 
* deeplearning.ai intro to deep learning course
* deeplearning.ai tensorflow in practice specialization
* Statistics with Python, coursera, Univeristy of Michigan
* Stanford CS231
* Google's Python Crash Course: https://developers.google.com/edu/python (just 1.1-1.3 to start)

NOTE: I DON'T like Andrew Ng's 'Machine Learning' course on Coursera. 

**On self-teaching:**
If you really wanna get started on deep learning I'd recommend picking one practical course (like fast.ai/tensorflow in practice) and one theory course (like deeplearning.ai) and going back and forth depending on how you feel. Then if you want can move on to hardcore stuff like CS231 and the Deep Learning book by Goodfellow et. al.

The same goes for stats. For me it makes such a difference to stumble through projects and learn theory side by side. Otherwise I get either bored or stuck.

In my opinion, you need to know enough coding to understand if-statements and for-loops and a maybe a couple day primer (like the google one) on Python to get started.
