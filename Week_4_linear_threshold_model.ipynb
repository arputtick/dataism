        "The *linear threshold model* is widely used to simulate the diffusion of information, behavior etc. throughout a social network. It can be used in combination with the *influence maximization problem,* in which one tries to identify the most influential individuals in a social network, i.e. those from whom information diffuses the most widely.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we observed in class, the assumptions made in the model are dubious, as are the ethics of using it, especially unbeknownst to the members of a given social network. It's also not clear that applying the LTM in such a setting as real-life social networks of homeless youth is at all effective. Though the model makes seemingly extreme simplifications about human behavior, it and similar models have at least proven effective in tasks related to efficiently diffusing information across online social networks, e.g., viral marketing. Of course it could also be used (even more) maliciously to help intentionally spread disinformation. Regardless of your own trust in the LTM, it's worth knowing about, particularly if we seek to criticize it's use.\n",

        "2) **Compute the influence weights:** For each ordered pair of individuals $(i,j)$, we compute an influence weight $w_{ij}$.\n",

        "3) **Color the 'seeds' in the graph:** These are the individuals with certain information or behavior that might be spread throughout the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) **For each node, set a 'threshold value':** This is a number between 0 and 1 that determines how difficult a person is to influence. \n",
        "\n",
        "5) **Spread influence:** For each individual, compare the total influence on that person with their threshold. If the total influence exceeds the threshold, that individual becomes a seed.\n",
        "\n",
